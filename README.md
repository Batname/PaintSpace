# PaintSpace
3D + VR Painting application built using Unreal Engine 4.

###Basics
PaintSpace is made for drawing in 3D space using an Oculus Rift and Leap Motion controller. Using hands for the controls, 3D drawings can be "painted" on a canvas of 3D space.

###Goals
- Explore and understand what it means to paint in 3-dimensional space, methods for doing so, and the implications or benefits of each.
- Develop an application that allows for such, and further incorporates various functionalities.
- These include: export of some "finished" product (dependent on method of painting/drawing), various options and utilities, controls that are easy to use.
- Finally, the culmination of the above in some "painting" that demonstrates value either as a resource or artistically, and showcases the capabilities of the application.

###In Development:
- [x] 3D Hand-based UI with multilayered menus
- [x] Gesture based movement in scene and additional controls
- [x] Exporting of drawn objects as .obj file
- [x] Improved "drawing" (placement and appearance of static meshes)
- [x] "Spray-paint" style drawing
- [ ] Creating of "photographs" based on drawn scene
- [ ] Wireframe drawing, wireframe based mesh creation, mesh surface painting (tentative)
- [x] UI options including: color/material change, drawing method change, undo/redo, etc.

###Examples
To be added.

###Acknowledgements
Thanks very much to Getnamo for his UE4 Leap Motion plugin!
